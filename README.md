# SNAKE in PyGame
This is my implementation of classic video game [**Snake**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) in Python game library [**PyGame**](https://pyga.me/)

# TODO
- [x] add body to snake (linked list? - NOPE simple list was enough)
  - [x] growing when eating fruit
- add game over
  - collision detection
  - largest snake possible
  - restart the game
- add score
  - add speeding up the snake as the score increases
  - highest score


- maybe try to containerize the game (Docker)
